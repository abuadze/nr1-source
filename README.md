ABOUT NR1 COIN
Our story
We are looking for creative innovations and ideas to make the world a better place, and to make the world, where we all live in, a better place for every human being. 

The world isn't stimulating us to come up with new innovations and ideas about improving existing technologies such as healthcare systems, education, agriculture, commerce, blockchain, software, robotics, data analytics, privacy and much more. ?We believe that many people living along us have those great ideas, but they don't have the opportunity to pitch them to the important people in the world. ?With NR1 we are making this possible. ?We will create a platform where people can pitch their ideas to the important and wealthy people in the world.
